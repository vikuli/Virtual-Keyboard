# ⌨️ Virtual Keyboard

With this virtual keyboard, you can enter or delete text and symbols and change the case of letters.

The keyboard is available in two languages - Russian and English. To change the language, simply press the "Alt" + "Shift" key combination on the virtual or physical keyboard. Please note that if the languages in the virtual keyboard and your system do not match, the keyboard will not work correctly. The language you choose is saved when you exit.

The keyboard is available here: [Virtual keyboard](https://vikuli.github.io/Virtual-Keyboard/keyboard/src/)

Have a good time!
